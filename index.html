                        really care why you visited us but I am here to make your visit spectacular. Now before all the
                        nice

                        first you need to know where you have come. Mostar is a place that lived through a lot and its
                        people are one of the most interesting and annoying people in the world. To find out more, I

                    <p>
                        This is a very specific topic that I am not sure I can explain in total. As you enter the city
                        of
                        Mostar, the first thing you notice is the people. If you are not from the southern world you
                        will
                        have some difficulties understanding it. This is a nation
                        located on the border of two worlds. The East and the West. It, alongside its people, lived
                        through
                        major historical events, many occupations and wars. Imagine how it is living in such an area.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So naturally, people have developed a coping mechanism for all those changes, and it is quite
                        weird.
                        That is especially present in the city of Mostar. It helps that Mostar is a pretty small city of
                        100
                        000 people at most. Combined with the great hospitality
                        and friendliness of citizens, everyone knows each other. The city works like a big community and
                        almost primal like human relations where helping and taking care of others is a primary activity
                        for
                        everyone. Mostar serves as a cradle
                        of culture, a place where nations collide and live together for centuries.
                    </p>
                    <p>People here are divided in so many ways (religious, by beliefs, nation...) and yet they all live
                        homogeneously one with another. As such, they are intricate and fragile. Any third party
                        relation
                        can and does mess with the overall life
                        of these people. This is why residents of Mostar have a specific relationship with visitors to
                        their
                        city. It is mocking, sarcastic and almost British like. Can be rude at times. It is very
                        specific
                        and connected to the current situation
                        that not a lot of people can understand. It is extremely hilarious to the ones understanding it
                        and
                        not funny at all to those who are witnessing it for the first time. </p>

                    Mostar evolved as an Ottoman frontier town in the 15th and 16th centuries, as well as during the
                    Austro-Hungarian period in the 19th and 20th centuries, spanning a deep valley of the Neretva River.
                    Mostar has long been known for its old Turkish homes
                    and the Stari Most Bridge, which is named for it. However, during the 1990s violence, most of the
                    ancient town was destroyed, including the Old Bridge, which was created by the renowned architect
                    Sinan.
                    With the help of an international
                    scientific commission established by UNESCO, the Old Bridge was recently repaired, and many of the
                    edifices in the Old Town have been restored or rebuilt. With its pre-Ottoman, eastern Ottoman,
                    Mediterranean, and western European architectural
                    characteristics, the Old Bridge region is a must-see.

                <p>
                    The settlement is situated in a valley of the Neretva River, between Hum Hill and the bottom of the
                    Vele
                    Mountain, and was formed as an urban structure in the 15th century on the crossing of a river and a
                    land
                    route. According to documented historical
                    records, this little village had two towers surrounding the bridge, which was built in 1459. Mostar,
                    the
                    current name, was first attested in 1474 and is derived from "mostari" - bridge guardians. Mostar
                    grew
                    as an Ottoman frontier town
                    in the 15th and 16th centuries, as well as during the brief Austro-Hungarian period in the 19th and
                    20th
                    centuries. Mostar has long been noted for its old Turkish homes and the Stari Most, or Old Bridge.

                <p> The historic area of Mostar is the consequence of a number of years of interaction between forces of
                    nature and human ingenuity. The global synthesis of life phenomena represents centuries of cultural
                    continuity: the bridge and its fortifications
                    with rich pre-Ottoman archeological strata, religious edifices, residential zones (mahalas), arable
                    grounds, dwellings, bazaar, and its public life in the streets and water. A common life of Muslims,
                    Christians, and Jews was depicted in
                    the architecture as a sign of tolerance. Mosques, churches, and synagogues coexisted in this region,
                    demonstrating that Roman Catholic Croats with their Western European culture, Eastern Orthodox Serbs
                    with their Byzantine components,
                    and Sephardic Jews coexisted alongside Bosniaks-Muslims for centuries. </p>
